# Quotes-App-Using-ViewModel
Its a quotes showing app where you can see quote and go to next to see the other quotes.
Here the quotes are showing from included json file and using gson to make object from the json file
Here I have used ViewModel to prevent to call onCreate after slide changes in activity like when you rotate your phone.
you can also share any quote using a floating action button.
