# Quotes-App-Using-ViewModel
Its a quotes showing app where you can see quote and go to next to see the other quotes.
Here the quotes are showing from a included json file in "assets" folder and using gson library to make object from the json file
Here I have used ViewModel to prevent to call onCreate after slide changes in activity like when you rotate your phone.
you can also share any quote using a floating action button.
